## 📖 Overview

This project implements a state-of-the-art **AI-based Signature Verification System** that uses deep learning to authenticate handwritten signatures. The system employs a **Siamese Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** architecture to learn similarity patterns between signature pairs, enabling accurate distinction between genuine and forged signatures.

The application features a user-friendly **Gradio web interface** that allows users to upload two signature images and receive instant verification results with confidence scores. Built with modularity and scalability in mind, this system can be easily extended for real-world applications in banking, legal documentation, and security systems.
